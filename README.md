Comments:
Lauren - A challenge I had while completing Assignment 11: Group Project was making sure my media queries were correct and the site was responsive on smaller screens.  Having struggled with BEM in the past, that was another one of my main challenges in this assignment.   Adjusting to group work from individual assignments was not difficult, as each member of our group was considerate, and our group leader Kylee was extremely helpful.  Overall, I struggled with BEM and media queries the most and the project was a positive experience for me.

Somer - One issue I had with centering my image on my page and resizing it, so it doesn't look pixelated. Another issue I had was trying to commit my changes in the terminal and push my changes to the main branch. Overall, I learned a lot from my group and our group leader Kylee, was always willing to help us when we were unsure about a code or how to commit changes.

Rachel - My biggest challenge this assignment was getting everything positioned how I wanted it to be positioned. In particular, coding different types of layouts responsive for all screens. It was an extensive process that took a long time, but it taught me a lot about how to do a webpage the right way. It also taught me how to spot out different errors that might be present in my code and fix them. Overall, this team was very supportive throughout and I learned a lot from our group leader, Kylee.

Traci - As I mentioned in my evaluation form, I had a lot of trouble creating a page that looked like what I had imagined. I was very frustrated because I spent a week struggling to put a template together and couldn’t make it do anything I had envisioned. I did my wireframe in Indesign. I know how to fix problems in Indesign, but I couldn’t fix the problems I had in CSS and HTML. Also, the whole GitHub environment was terrifying and I had a lot of trouble with it. I really leaned on Kylee for help with GitHub and terminal commands.

Kylee - The main challenge I experienced when working on the homepage was getting the aside to float to the right side of the main content. Other issues encountered were primarily linked to the terminal and pushing things to the github account. However, when they came up I was able to work through the issues with the help of the internet and terminal error codes. Overall, I really enjoyed everything I learned from this project and I loved being able to be a group leader. Everyone was very nice and worked hard to make this project happen!

Extra Note:
There may be some unevenness in the pushs to the repository due to me (Kylee) going in and making final edits to the overall website. This will also be because of me helping some roup members with their html and css. I also wanted to note that some of the pushes were directly to the main branch due to accidently working on the main branch instead of on their local branch and issues with terminal and github. I also pushed the final edits directly to the main branch.
